The DDSM(Digital Database for Screening Mammography) is a database of 2,620 scanned film mammography studies.

It contains normal, benign, and malignant cases with verified pathology information.

The scale of the database along with ground truth validation makes the DDSM a useful tool in the development and testing of decision support systems.
